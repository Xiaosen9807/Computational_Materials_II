# Computational_Materials_II

It's a presentation project of Computational_Materials_II in my Master periods in TUD.

First, I used the API from Materials project and get the data of many crystals. 
Second, I created a encoder to encode every crystal names and properities 
Third, I used random forest and DNN to learn the dataset.
Fourth, an evolutionary strategy was applied to find the crystal with highest hardness based on the DNN model.
