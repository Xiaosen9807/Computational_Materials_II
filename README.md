# Computational_Materials_II

It's a presentation project of Computational_Materials_II in my Master periods in TUD.

First, we used the API from Materials project and get the data of many crystals. 

Second, we created a encoder to encode every crystal names and properities. 

Third, we used random forest and DNN to learn the dataset. 

Fourth, an evolutionary strategy was applied to find the crystal with highest hardness based on the DNN model.

Computational.py is to format the dataset.
